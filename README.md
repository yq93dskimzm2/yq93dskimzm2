`I'm a self-taught Security Researcher and Developer :)` \
I'm also a fan of privacy and I learn a lot about cyber in the military.


## Contact me on Session :

If you want to work with me contact me, I'm searching for rust and assembly developers, reverse engineer, pentesters and more.

## Programming languages:
[![Programming](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,md,lua,bash,powershell,py,js,ts,php,java,cs,cpp,rust,regex)](https://skillicons.dev)

For some of these languages I have learned the basics in order to get by (php,java,cs,cpp) but I don't use them much any more as they are not very suitable for my projects. I still continue to use html,css,js/ts for web and wasm (it's rare), markdown for README, lua for FiveM, bash and powershell when I need it for a little script, python for POC, regex when I need it and for the majority of my projects I'm using RUST.

I also learn assembly when I have time.

## Frameworks:
[![Frameworks](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tailwind,django,flask,discordjs,electron,nextjs,bun,actix,rocket,tauri,wasm)](https://skillicons.dev)

Like I said in programming my projects are mainly developed in Rust but I used some of these frameworks in the past like discordjs, and rn I'm using serenity...

## Databases:
[![Databases](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=mysql,mongodb,postgres,sqlite,graphql)](https://skillicons.dev)

I've used a lot of databases but for the moment I mainly use SurrealDB

## Tools :
[![IDE](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=idea,clion,rider,phpstorm,pycharm,androidstudio,eclipse,vscode,vscodium,arduino,atom,neovim)](https://skillicons.dev)

Most of the time I use JetBrains IDE, but I use some others IDE in some times

[![Adobe](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ae,au,ai,ps,pr,blender)](https://skillicons.dev)

From time to time I learn graphic design and video editing, but it's rare.

[![Others](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cloudflare,bots,docker,git,github,notion,obsidian,postman,wordpress)](https://skillicons.dev)

I also use some tools such as obsidian for my notes, github for my projects, ...

## Operating Systems :
[![OS](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=windows,linux,debian,ubuntu,redhat,mint,arch,kali)](https://skillicons.dev)

I have a lot of VM to test my tools and to practice dynamic analysis

## Projects:
I am currently working on making (everything will be in rust)
- A secure linux system like qubes with an hypervisor. (After this one I'll probably create my own osint/pentest distribution)
- Binaries like ls/mkdir/... to use them in my systems.
- Osint tools for each platform. (proton, discord)
- Pentest tools for each case. (sqlmap,ssrfmap,...)
- Security tools (passmanager,...)

My goal for these tools is to improve my speed and efficiency in penetration testing, and to help people become better too.

All these projects will be closed source and licensed, and of course anyone will be able to buy them with the necessary money.

Of course I know all of these projects will not be finished in 2024 but I work as much as possible on them everyday.

And for those wondering, I don't collect any user data, so the only interactions with the Internet I'll be doing with systems under my control will be for security purposes such as license validation etc...
I'm going to make sure that these tools are a safe bet for users. I'm thinking in particular of people who will be using them in military, government or police settings. I won't have any control over what you do with the tools, and I won't know anything about what you do with them.
