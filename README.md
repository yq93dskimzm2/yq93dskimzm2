## Programming languages:
[![Programming](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,md,lua,bash,powershell,py,js,ts,php,java,cs,cpp,rust,regex)](https://skillicons.dev)

For some of these languages I have learned the basics in order to get by (php,java,cs,cpp) but I don't use them much any more as they are not very suitable for my projects. I still continue to use html,css,js/ts for web and wasm, markdown for README, lua for FiveM, bash and powershell when I need to do a little script, python for POC, regex when I need it and for the majority of my projects I'm using RUST.

I also learn assembly when I have time.

## Frameworks:
[![Frameworks](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=tailwind,django,flask,discordjs,electron,nextjs,bun,actix,rocket,tauri,wasm)](https://skillicons.dev)

Like I said in programming my projects are mainly developed in Rust but I used some of these frameworks in the past like discordjs, and rn I'm using serenity...

## Databases:
[![Databases](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=mysql,mongodb,postgres,sqlite,graphql)](https://skillicons.dev)

I've used a lot of databases but for the moment I mainly use SurrealDB

## Tools :
[![IDE](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=idea,clion,rider,phpstorm,pycharm,androidstudio,eclipse,vscode,vscodium,arduino,atom,neovim)](https://skillicons.dev)

Most of the time I use JetBrains IDE, but I use some others IDE in some times

[![Adobe](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ae,au,ai,ps,pr,blender)](https://skillicons.dev)

From time to time I learn graphic design and video editing, but it's rare.

[![Others](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cloudflare,bots,docker,git,github,notion,obsidian,postman,wordpress)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Operating Systems :
[![OS](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=windows,linux,debian,ubuntu,redhat,mint,arch,kali)](https://skillicons.dev)

I have a lot of VM to test my tools and to practice dynamic analysis

## Projects:
Most of my projects are private and I keep the tools I develop for myself, my friends and the people I work with. \
I mainly develop osint and pentest tools to be faster and more efficient
